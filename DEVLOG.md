# This is not a CHANGELOG
It is a verbose running commentary with no relationship to versioning.
File should be read top-to-bottom for chronological order.
The contents of this file will be periodically archived and purged to keep the log related to the "current events" of the code base.

------

### 2016.09.09
 271744    2856   10072  284672   New baseline after massive upheaval in Manuvr.

This needs to be investigated. But I'm willing to bet that it's a simple goof I will find on accident if I ignore it for awhile. I have the whole weekend to knock down some hard problems. Let's see where this goes...

 266344    2856   10072  279272   As expected... Some cleanup in Manuvr yields this.

------

### 2016.09.10
   266752    2816   10076  279644   Following the platform abstraction.

------

### 2016.09.24
Tuned out of this project for two weeks for work and hardware issues. ManuvrOS
  saw steady improvements in that period.

  281088    2800    9764  293652   47b14   Struck lstdc++ from the linker.
  281080    2800    9764  293644   47b0c   Struck lgcc from the linker.

I forgot why those linkages were ever there to begin with...

### 2016.10.31:

RN driver... Prior to member re-work to use a Pin object.

    make DEBUG=1

    281856    2800    9664  294320 Following conversion of gpioSetup()
    281936    2800    9664  294400 GPIO treatment is now safe.
    282064    2800    9664  294528 GPIO mapper completed and safe.

    283388    2800    9700  295888 Building up support for the BT module.

My god.... RNBase has bad smell. Three refactors died in there and were never cleaned out.

    283564    2800    9716  296080 Can stand it no longer... About to cull...
    283628    2800    9780  296208 My hasty class-merger actually compiled.

    283348    2800    9732  295880 Consolidating some inlines. Adding granularity to IO_WAIT.
    283036    2800    9508  295344 Stripped some complexity from session notify().
    283492    2800    9496  295788 Migrated gpio_5 fxns out of RNBase. Pruned cruft.
    283388    2800    9496  295684 Relocation of hardware-specifics.
    283236    2800    9496  295532 Cutting some needless string.
