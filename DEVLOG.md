------

### 2016.09.09
 271744    2856   10072  284672   New baseline after massive upheaval in Manuvr.

This needs to be investigated. But I'm willing to bet that it's a simple goof I will find on accident if I ignore it for awhile. I have the whole weekend to knock down some hard problems. Let's see where this goes...

 266344    2856   10072  279272   As expected... Some cleanup in Manuvr yields this.

------

### 2016.09.10
   266752    2816   10076  279644   Following the platform abstraction.

------

### 2016.09.24
Tuned out of this project for two weeks for work and hardware issues. ManuvrOS
  saw steady improvements in that period.

  281088    2800    9764  293652   47b14   Struck lstdc++ from the linker.
  281080    2800    9764  293644   47b0c   Struck lgcc from the linker.

I forgot why those linkages were ever there to begin with...
