#### What is in this repository:

**./doc**:  Documentation related to this project, which can be built by running...

    doxygen Doxyfile

**./lib**:  External dependencies.

**./src**:  Original (unless otherwise specified) source code for Digitabulum.

#### Building the device firmware

    # Clone...
    git clone https://github.com/Manuvr/Digitabulum-Firmware.git
    cd Digitabulum-Firmware

    # Download dependencies...
    ./downloadDeps.sh


Specific build instructions and platform issues are located in the corresponding src/Targets directory.

#### Building the CPLD
Altera's software is required to build the CPLD. It is presently outside the scope of this document.

Because digits are interchangable, and the slot is barely large enough for it, IMU calibration data will be stored in the microcontroller-bound memory. If the application demands, the microcontroller firmware can optionally setup a trust relationship with the hardware to detect when it is connected to a different board.
