Digitabulum is an inertial motion-capture glove designed to be modular and open.

####What is in this repository:
**./3DModels**: Blender models. This includes models of the physical pieces that comprise a finished unit as well as their molds.

**./compiler**:  The gcc compiler and the libraries for the STM32F7.

**./doc**:  Documentation related to this project, which can be built by running...

    doxygen Doxyfile

**./lib**:  Libraries that were not written by Manuvr.

**./src**:  Original (unless otherwise specified) source code for Digitabulum.


----------------------
####Building the device firmware under linux
Because the compiler and all the dependencies are included in this repo, this ought to be as easy as...

    # Clone...
    git clone https://github.com/Manuvr/Digitabulum-Firmware.git
    cd Digitabulum-Firmware

    # Unpack the toolchain and download dependencies...
    ./unpackTools.sh
    ./downloadDeps.sh

    # Build...
    make

If that succeeded and your system has DFU support, you can then plug your glove into a USB port, press the bootloader button, and...

    make program
