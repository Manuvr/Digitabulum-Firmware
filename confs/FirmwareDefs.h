This is one of the files that the application author is required to provide.
This is where definition of (application or device)-specific parameters ought to go.

This is an example file for building firmware on linux. Anticipated target is a Raspi.
  but that shouldn't matter too much. These settings are only typically relevant for
  reasons of memory-constraint, threading model (if any), or specific features that
  this hardware can support.

/*
* PROTOCOL_MTU is required for constraining communication length due to memory restrictions at
*   one-or-both sides. Since the protocol currently supports up to (2^24)-1 bytes in a single transaction,
*   a microcontroller would want to limit its counter-party's use of precious RAM. PROTOCOL_MTU, therefore,
*   determines the effective maximum packet size for this device, and by extension, the sessions in which
*   it participates.
