Overview:
================================================================================
This class contains implementation details for the CPLD. So this is probably the
  best place for an overview of the CPLD as it applies to software.

The first actions on power-up ought to include reading the version register.
  Versions start at 1. If the CPLD version is ever zero, it means that the CPLD
  is not initialized, and the class will refuse to operate for safety reasons.

This class was not written with portability in mind. The particular CPLD (or
  FPGA) is unimportant, but this class will make assumptions about memory
  regions and hardware layers, and was not intended to be a pattern for porting.

This driver decends from Digitabulum's r0 CPLD driver, which ran on an STM32F4.

The CPLD is responsible for these tasks:
  1) Managing the SPI buses for each of the IMUs in the system.
  2) Aggregating interrupts from the IMUs and making them accessible to the CPU.
  3) Storing its own revision number in a register accessible via SPI.
  4) Detecting the presence or absense of a digit.

It is NOT responsible for having a concept of chirality. Digit identifiers used
  in this context refer to a specific connector on the main PCB. Chirality is a
  software notion that is introduced in ManuLegend, where digits are numbered
  1-5 following anatomical convention. Chirality is discussed there.

The metacarpals position is alternately known as "Digit 0", since it is
  addressed as if it were the first-of-six digits.

The CPLD is bus master on both SPI1 and SPI2.


IRQs:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This class is the first class to become aware of IRQs from the sensor package.
Potential sources of interrupt...
  * Four IRQ signals for each IMU in a fully-populated glove (68 total signals)
  * IRQs related to the loss or detection of a digit (6 signals)
  * Any of the 4 user-assignable IRQs

We have up-to 68 IMU IRQs to manage (4 IRQs per-sensor, with 17 sensors). Since
  we don't want to send 68 wires back to the CPU, we serialize them and send an
  80-bit message back to the CPU. That message is handled when the SPI2_CS line
  rises. From that point a comparison can be made against the last reported IRQ
  message and signals delivered to the classes responsible for handling them.

IRQs are aggregated and checked for validity by internal CPLD logic. If a
  difference is found, the entire IRQ signal set is sent back to the CPU via
  SPI2. It is the responsibility of the software to make sense of the
  differences. But if everything is operating correctly, each received IRQ
  message will be different from its predecesor by at least one bit.

To facilitate power-management, any given IRQ signal can be mapped to the CPU's
  special WAKEUP interrupt pin.


Changing between clock sources:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the time of writing, the CPLD can be driven either by its own internal
  oscillator, or by the CPU using a timer channel. When driven externally, the
  clock is adjustable within the range of DC to 20MHz. The clock is divided once
  internally to arrive at the 10MHz maximum imposed by the sensors.

The internal oscilator is the default source to ensure proper startup and reset
  behavior. When switching to the external clock source, the CPU should first
  enable the timer output, and only after it is running, send the command to the
  CPLD to switch to it. The inverse order should be followed when moving from
  EXT to INT clocks.

Most cases would want to drive the clock signal in direct proportion to their
  data demands, thus only using the amount of power required. But the use of the
  internal oscillator allows the CPU (and its timer peripheral) to be shutdown
  while still retaining sensitivity to interrupts. Combined with WAKEUP routing.
  this allows the program to put the glove into very low power states with
  runtime-selectable wakeup conditions.

The clock source can be changed at any time. Bus operations can continue
  uninterrupted throughout the transition between clock domains.


These are the hardware pin assignments and descriptions for the CPLD:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CPLD Pin     | CPU Port/Pin | Description
  =============|==============|===========================================
  SPI1_CS      | PA4          | SPI1 is the main bus. Data and requests
  SPI1_CLK     | PA5          |   traverse this path. CPLD is master.
  SPI1_MISO    | PA6          |
  SPI1_MOSI    | PA7          |
  SPI2_CS      | PB12         | SPI2 is for the exclusive purpose
  SPI2_CLK     | PB13         |   moving interrupt data. CPLD is
  SPI2_MISO    | PB14         |   the master.
  SPI2_MOSI    | PB15         |
  CPLD_EXT_CLK | PA8          | External clock for the CPLD.
  CPLD_RESET   | PB9          | Resets the CPLD. Active low.
  CPLD_GPIO_0  | PE11         | Reserved. CPLD output.
  CPLD_GPIO_1  | PE14         | Reserved. CPLD output.
  IRQ_WAKEUP   | PC13         | CPLD output.



CPLD register access procedure:
================================================================================
Despite being the bus slave, the CPU is responsible for initiating the transfer
  by pulling the SPI1_CS line low. The CPU must hold the pin low for at least
  one complete CPLD clock cycle. After that, the CPU should release the pin and
  wait for the SPI1_CS line to rise. This indicates transfer completion.

The CPLD registers were constructed in the same fasion as those of the IMUs. The
  most-significant bit is the R/~W bit.


CPLD internal register access procedure:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Register | R/~W  | Internal | Width | Description
  =========|=======|==========|=======|==================================
  0x28     | R     | (CS_0)   |  8    | VERSION
  0x29     | R/W   | (CS_1)   |  8    | CONFIG
  0x2A     | R     | (CS_2)   |  8    | STATUS
  0x2B     | R     | (CS_3)   |  8    | DIGIT_PRESENT
  0x2C     | R     | (CS_4)   |  8    | Reserved
  0x2D     | R     | (CS_5)   |  8    | Reserved
  0x2E     | R     | (CS_6)   |  8    | Reserved
  0x2F     | R     | (CS_7)   |  8    | Reserved

  /--------------< 1 byte >----\
  | Register  |     DATA       |
  \----------------------------/

VERSION register is read-only, and stores an 8-bit integer reflecting the
  version of the currently-burned CPLD.

CONFIG register
  Bit | Function
  ----|------------
  0   | IRQ_RATE_0  // These two bits set the IRQ scan prescaler.
  1   | IRQ_RATE_1     0: Scan off   1: 1x      2: 2x      3: 4x
  2   | Reserved
  3   | Reserved
  4   | Reserved
  5   | Reserved
  6   | OSC_SEL     // 0: Internal oscillator (default)   1: External clock
  7   | IRQ_XFER    // Set when an IRQ transfer is in-progress. Set to initiate.


DIGIT_PRESENT register (read-only)
  Bit | Function
  ----|------------
  0   | Metacarpals
  1   | Digit 1
  2   | Digit 2
  3   | Digit 3
  4   | Digit 4
  5   | Digit 5
  6   | 0
  7   | 0

The address of the desired internal register should prefix the desired value (in
  the case of a write), or (if reading) will be followed by the present value
  stored in that register.
All CPLD registers should be accessed byte-wise. All traffic to an internal
  register therefore occupies two bytes on the SPI1 bus.

  DEV_ADDR | Digit | Position | Aspect

  0x20     |   5   | Intrmedt | Magnetic
  0x21     |   5   | Distal   | Magnetic

  /-------------------------------------------------------------------------\
  | DEV_ADDR  | XFER_LEN  | DEV_COUNT | REG_ADDR  |          DATA           |
  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------/
        1           1           1           1       <XFER_LEN * DEV_COUNT>

  DEV_ADDR:  The address of the desired aspect of the desired IMU. One byte.
  XFER_LEN:  The size of the I/O operation WRT to each sensor. One byte.
  DEV_COUNT: The number of devices to traverse in this operation. One byte.
  REG_ADDR:  The address of the desired register within the IMU. One byte.
  DATA:      dialog with IMU. <XFER_LEN * DEV_COUNT> bytes.

The XFER_LEN byte dictates how many bytes we transfer per address not including
  the register selection byte.

IE, to read 6-bytes of vector data from the magnetometer at the distal position
  of digit-1, the transfer would be...
  /-------------------------------------------------------< 6 bytes >-------\
  |   0xA5    |   0x06    |   0x01    |   0xA8    |     0x00 .... 0x00      |
  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------/

DEV_COUNT is the number of times we wish this access to be repeated over
  successive devices.

REG_ADDR is the first byte of IMU-directed bus traffic. In the case of accesses
  that span many devices, it is captured as the fourth byte and repeated
  transparently at device boundaries. Modifying the example above to read the
  magnetometer vectors from each sensor on digit-1 (3 total)...
  /------------------------------------------------------< 18 bytes >-------\
  |   0xA5    |   0x06    |   0x03    |   0xA8    |     0x00 .... 0x00      |
  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------/

The real gains come from the extension of read operations across ALL sensors.
  To read an entire frame of inertial data (2 Vector3<int16> from 17 sensors)...
  /------------------------------------------------------< 204 bytes >------\
  |   0x80    |   0x0C    |   0x11    |   0xD8    |     0x00 .... 0x00      |
  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Combined with the full-frame magnetometer read, we get a full frame of sensor
  data in two bus operations, thereby minimizing the bureaucracy associated with
  transfer-management.
  /------------------------------------------------------< 102 bytes >------\
  |   0x91    |   0x06    |   0x11    |   0xA8    |     0x00 .... 0x00      |
  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------/


Ranked IMU Access
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In CPLD r1, ranked-access is only useful for write operations. It allows for
  synchronous configuration of IMUs sharing a rank, and saves software the
  burden of tracking delta-T independently for each sensor. Apart from being
  write-only, the transfer rules are the same as for individual IMU access.

  DEV_ADDR | Digit | Position | Aspect
  =========|=======|==========|==========================================
  0x22     |  ALL  | Proximal | Magnetic  (6 sensors)
  0x23     |  ALL  | Intrmedt | Magnetic  (Note: Only 5 sensors here!)
  0x24     |  ALL  | Distal   | Magnetic  (6 sensors)
  0x25     |  ALL  | Proximal | Inertial  (6 sensors)
  0x26     |  ALL  | Intrmedt | Inertial  (Note: Only 5 sensors here!)
  0x27     |  ALL  | Distal   | Inertial  (6 sensors)

The metacarpals and wrist complex (digit-0) does not have an intermediate
  position. This is why there are only 5 sensors in that rank. Fortunately,
  this is largely irrelevant, as each rank is treated as a single device.

Assuming the configuration of the IMUs is identical, configuring the entire
  sensor package can be done with two bus operations; one for each aspect.

As is the case with individual IMU access, REG_ADDR will be captured in an
  internal register and replicated to each IMU as the transfer crosses device
  boundaries.
