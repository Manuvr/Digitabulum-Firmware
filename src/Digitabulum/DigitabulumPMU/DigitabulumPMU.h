Our goal is to encapsulate power-supply concerns to this class. This
  class may later be used as the prototype for a generalized PMU kernel
  driver. Until then, we will hard-code i2c addresses, pin numbers, etc.

Digitabulum's power-management subsystem consists of...
  * A TI INA219 (Voltage monitor and consumption rate)
  * A Microchip MCP73833 (LiPo charge management)
