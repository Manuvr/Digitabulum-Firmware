Our goal is to encapsulate power-supply concerns to this class. This
  class may later be used as the prototype for a generalized PMU kernel
  driver. Until then, we will hard-code i2c addresses, pin numbers, etc.

Digitabulum's power-management subsystem consists of...
  * A TI INA219 (Voltage monitor and consumption rate)
  * A Microchip MCP73833 (LiPo charge management)


Regarding the battery in Digitabulum
================================================================================
r1 uses a 1485mAh LiPo.


Regarding the MCP73833 (charge controller)
================================================================================
Any other statX combinations are meaningless because it could mean many things.

stat1 stat2   Condition             This table is complicated by the fact that
---------------------------------     the stat lines were intended to be hooked
  L     H     Charge-in-progress      to LEDs for a human. So they pulse and do
  H     L     Charge complete         other things. For this reason, we track
  L     L     System test mode        the system time of falling edges.


Regarding the INA219 (fuel gauge)
================================================================================
In Digitabulum, the shunt resistor is Yageo part number RL1210FR-070R2L. It is
  0.2-ohm.
