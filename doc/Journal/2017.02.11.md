 271744    2856   10072  284672   New baseline after massive upheaval in Manuvr.

This needs to be investigated. But I'm willing to bet that it's a simple goof I will find on accident if I ignore it for awhile. I have the whole weekend to knock down some hard problems. Let's see where this goes...

 266344    2856   10072  279272   As expected... Some cleanup in Manuvr yields this.

    283388    2800    9700  295888 Building up support for the BT module.

My god.... RNBase has bad smell. Three refactors died in there and were never cleaned out.

    283564    2800    9716  296080 Can stand it no longer... About to cull...
    283628    2800    9780  296208 My hasty class-merger actually compiled.

### 2016.11.23:

Given the pending manufacture of the digits, about to revisit some things in the IMU data pathways. First, some baselines...

    274996    2800    9456  287252   46214  make
    283220    2800    9496  295516   4825c  make DEBUG=1

    make DEBUG=1
    283220    2800    9496  295516   4825c  New baseline.
    283220    2800    9496  295516   4825c  Rework of if-else chains into switch-case yields no difference.

I very much dislike this arcane key-sequence console.

It might be time to formally abandon the notion of individual IMUs being discrete bus entities, and allow the LegendManager class to be the intermediary (and memory store) for all IIU classes, which would do no allocation for these purposes.

Feed the base pointer in for register space, and let the IMU class calculate appropriate offsets from the base given the IMU count supported. I won't delve into the chain of inference that leads me to this conclusion here, but doing this would have the consequence that all IMUs must be run at the same sample-rate. This might be a sane assumption anyhow.

    Reworking some basics in IIU/IMU classes....
    283476    2800    9496  295772   4835c  Moved boolean members to flags.
    283556    2800    9496  295852   483ac  Making some class members constant.
    283492    2800    9496  295788   4836c  Alignment change to make gains evident.
    283492    2800    9496  295788   4836c  More flag condensation.
    283540    2800    9496  295836   4839c  CPLD conversion to BusAdapter.
    283476    2800   11072  297348   48984  Static allocation of IMU register memory.

_---J. Ian Lindsay_

------

### 2016.11.28:

The CPLD driver is now fully separated from the concerns of IMUs. It is a general bus adapter.

Re-wrote some IIU lookup functions as inlines. They were not referenced anywhere, so they may disappear completely. Now that the drivers don't have to deal with the heterogeneous bus topology that r0 exhibited, the drivers can more cleanly carved into functional units.

    283508    2800   11080  297388   489ac  Rounding out some CPLD function defs.
    283700    2800   35760  322260   4ead4  Temporarily made IIU class static to see mem impact.

And there we have it... All IMU/IIU driver classes are now stack-defined and will not burden the heap.
Turning in for the night.

_---J. Ian Lindsay_

    283572    2800   42960  329332   50674  Moved InertialMeasurement queue to static for a bit.

    284916    2728   42576  330220   New baseline ahead of Manuvr BusOp consolidation.
    284972    2728   43196  330896   Following BusOp consolidation. No RNBase yet.
    285004    2728   43196  330928   Additions to template. About to convert RNBase.
    285604    2728   43160  331492   RNBase now extends BusAdapter.
    285660    2728   43156  331544   52-bytes of flash for 4-bytes of RAM? Yes.
    285436    2728   43156  331320   Taking some gains back from templates.
    285436    2728   43156  331320   Pushing more code replication back into template.
    286036    2728   43156  331920   More untanglement.

### 2017.01.14:

Took a few weeks to do hardware stuff. Digit and metacarpals flex units arrive and test good, aside from my goof with the mirrored connector. Bus operations do not cycle out of the queue after completing successfully. So that's my immediate next task. But I'm going to spend some time culling obsolete code first, to come up to speed.

    make DEBUG=1
    286988    2728   43144  332860   Tonight's baseline.
    287892    2728   43184  333804   Expanded IRQ work.
    287284    2728   43152  333164   Fixed SPI1 for the moment.

_---J. Ian Lindsay_

------

### 2017.01.18:

Bus is fixed (enough). DMA handler still broken on every-other transfer. Code needs to migrate inward from the IMU driver classes, toward ManuManager, and ManuManager need to undergo mitosis to isolate the hardware layer from data concerns. The CPLD in r1 allows us to (in principle) run a single class instance for all the sensor handling that operates on aggregates, rather than r0's one-instance-per-physical-device.

IIU's connective role is vestigial, and its data processing role is no longer confined to individual IMUs. Given that it already has an established relationship with ManuManager, it will (for now) be retained as the front-end of the data pipeline (as it was before), but will be fed by ManuManager, rather than the existing driver classes.

    make DEBUG=1
    287284    2728   43152  333164   Tonight's baseline.

_---J. Ian Lindsay_

### 2017.01.28:

    make DEBUG=1
    287284    2728   43152  333164   Former baseline.
    280156    2656   30376  313188   Compiles again following memory re-org.
    280092    2656   30336  313084   Consolidated acc and gyr read ops into one.
    280132    2880   30336  313348   Removed stop-gap mem space. Cleaned up some TODO.
    280228    2880   30272  313380   Cutting fields that don't make sense anymore.
    280220    2880   30272  313372   More field remeval ahead of migrations to Integrator.
    280220    2880   29832  312932   Integrator is starting to not care about sample type.
    279836    2880   20040  302756   The big drop. Note below.
    279564    2880   19880  302324   More removal of redundant members.
    279500    2880   19264  301644   Removal of value cache in IMU classes.
    278964    2880   19264  301108   Removal of dead code.

Lots of things are broken. There are a few stubs, and much dead code. IMU pointer
maps are contained within a const class and array'd out as non-static members.

Debriding and suturing...

Note on the big drop: Eliminated the giant buffers in the IMU classes that were
  only needed during calibration, and was formerly a trade-off between resting
  memory load versus efficient pipeline. This trade-off has been resolved in r1.

### 2017.02.03:

Tonight's mission will be to un-kink the SPI DMA handlers on the F7 and begin extending functionality WRT IMU handlers.

    make DEBUG=1
    279396    2936   19264  301596  Tonights baseline.

Relocated the static register stuff into its own source file.

    make DEBUG=1
    279332    2936   18992  301260  Removed crappy logging buffer.
    280292    2936   19464  302692  Finished RegPtrMap.
    280332    2936   19464  302732  Adding debugging aids ahead of firmware flash. Must test ranked access.

First firmware flash in about two weeks. DMA problem appears fixed-enough to run my ranked-access tests, which, despite not being full-coverage, are passing without issue.

This was a bonus feature that cost very little to add to the CPLD. But now that I know it validates, I can write commands to IMUs by rank, in parallel. Different values can be written to each rank, but all members of a rank must have the same value.

This will solve some data-concurrency issues that were present in r0 (frame-skew), as well as save an enormous amount of bandwidth for write operations that meet the qualifying criteria. Initializing the IMUs can now be done with 57 bytes on the bus versus the 211 it would take without ranked writes.

This also marked the final validation of IMU/CPLD address correspondence. Theory is confirmed to have produced a matching implementation.

OshPark PCBs for r2's debug harness got in yesterday. The connectors arrive today, so I will be hot-plating.


    make DEBUG=1
    280652    2936   19464  303052  Ahead of another cruft removal wave in IMU class.
    280652    2936   19328  302916  Ahead of alignment changes.
    280652    2936   19264  302852  IMU alignment changes.
    280716    2936   19192  302844  Improving RegPtrMap along the way.
    280788    2936   19056  302780  More cruft removal from IMU class.
    281004    2936   19056  302996  Extending SensorFrame debug output.
    281004    2936   24336  308276  Adding members to the SensorFrame.
    281068    2936   28872  312876  Adding members to the SensorFrame.
    280684    2936   28872  312492  Removing dead code.

### 2017.02.11:

Porting efforts to ESP-IDF has forced repo re-org. With the r2 hardware arriving in the next few days, this is a good place to bookmark the code base.

    make DEBUG=1
    280684    2936   28872  312492   Final binary size for STM32F7 build.
